My Weekly Goals
I will make sure that find you and explain to me some things i did not understand in some lessons mainly in Frontend Web Development.
I will look for opportunities to speak in front of the class to gain self- confidence.
I will raise my hand more when the teacher asks for answers from the class.
I will have raised my hand atleast five times to answer questions.
